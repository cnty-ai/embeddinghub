# Quickstart

    In this tutorial, we'll:
    1. Deploy a local feature store
    2. Register and define some features
    3. Generate a training dataset

    *Coming Soon*
    6. Load features into online store
    7. Fetch online features

## Overview
    In this tutorial, we'll use Featureform to register features and generate
    a training dataset for a our titanic survial model. With Featureform, we'll 
    be able to 
        - define our features 
        - search for our registered features

## Step 1: Install Featureform
Install the Python SDK via pip

```
pip install featureform
```

## Step 2: Create a repository
    Our repository will contain: 
    - data/ contains our raw titanic dataset
    - example.py contains our feature definitions
    - feature_store.yaml contains a demo setup configuring where data sources are

## Step 3: Register feature definitons and deploy


## Step 4: Generating a training dataset

## Step 5: Load features into online store
## Step 6: Fetch online features
